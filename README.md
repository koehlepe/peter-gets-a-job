# Peter Gets A Job

Let's see if I remember how to do this.

## Phase 1: Manual Process

Grab a couple of postings and work through the application process.
It doesn't matter initially if the job postings fit because part of the process is deciding whether to move forward with the application process. What is important is that we capture all the information that was needed to decided what to do next with the posting.

Alright, I need a format that works as a start for storing these jobs. At the very least, I need the company, the job title and the job description. I'm going to start with simple text files that I'll store in the /data folder. I am starting with the jobs LinkedIn has suggested as "Top Picks".
