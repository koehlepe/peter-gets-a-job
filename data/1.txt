About the job

Woven by Toyota is enabling Toyota’s once-in-a-century transformation into a mobility company. Inspired by a legacy of innovating for the benefit of others, our mission is to challenge the current state of mobility through human-centric innovation — expanding what “mobility” means and how it serves society.

Our work centers on four pillars: AD/ADAS, our autonomous driving and advanced driver assist technologies; Arene, our software development platform for software-defined vehicles; Woven City, a test course for mobility; and Cloud & AI, the digital infrastructure powering our collaborative foundation. Business-critical functions empower these teams to execute, and together, we’re working toward one bold goal: a world with zero accidents and enhanced well-being for all.

TEAM

The ADAS Simulation and Validation Tools group accelerates the development of advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and autonomous driving (L2–L4) software by building scalable simulation platforms, cloud infrastructure, and automated testing pipelines. Our tools enable global engineering teams to validate complex driving systems efficiently and with confidence.

We focus on large-scale data workflows that ingest, transform, and correlate real-world and simulated driving data. This data powers critical simulation experiments and analytics tools used to improve driving system performance and guide strategic decisions. Our team sits at the intersection of simulation, cloud engineering, and data analysis—solving challenges in automation, scalability, and system validation to support cutting-edge vehicle programs.
